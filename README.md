# Cutecloud

This prototype implementation aims to create a Nextcloud-like cloud solution using Cutelyst, Grantlee, Qt and C++.

# Goals

* small executable
* small RAM usage
* small CPU usage
* low latency
* (if possible) compatibility with Nextcloud ("drop in replacement")
* (if possible) compatibility with Nextcloud clients (desktop/ mobile)

# Thanks

* [Cutelyst](cutelyst.org) is used as base framework for this web page
* [Grantlee](https://github.com/steveire/grantlee) is used as templating engine
* [Qt](www.qt.io) is the C++ framework in which this project, Cutelys and Grantlee are all written
